    <div class="professional-title">UX Researcher & Behavioral Scientist</div>

    <p class="opening-statement">I'm a behavioral neuroscientist turned UX researcher with over ten years of experience designing and running experiments on learning, motivation, and decision-making.</p>

    <p>I specialize in uncovering how context, reward, and feedback shape real-world decisions.</p>

    <p>In my UX work, I combine the rigor of quantitative experimentation with the depth of qualitative research to help teams understand not just what users do but why. I turn complex behavioral data into clear, actionable insights through storytelling, visualization, and cross-team collaboration.</p>

    <p>Before moving into UX, I earned my PhD studying motivation and decision-making, building custom tools, behavioral pipelines, and data systems to make sense of complex behavior. That background continues to shape how I approach research: behavior-first, evidence-driven, and guided by curiosity about what helps people learn and adapt.</p>
