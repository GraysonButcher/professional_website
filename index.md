    <div class="professional-title">UX Researcher & Behavioral Scientist</div>

    <p class="opening-statement">I’m a User Researcher with an extensive background in behavioral neuroscience, and I’ve spent the last decade studying how people learn, adapt, and make decisions in the real world.</p>

    <p>Today, I bring that same behavior-first approach to UX by using both quantitative and mixed-methods research to understand what users do, why they do it, and what’s getting in their way. I love figuring out where motivation breaks, frustration spikes, or feedback loops fail, because that’s where better design can have outsized impact.</p>

    <p>Across digital products, services, and learning programs, I’ve helped teams find actionable insights that make a real difference for their users. I pride myself on my storytelling, data visualization, and ability to collaborate. As a hobbyist tinkerer, I also really enjoy building digital and physical tools, especially those that help automate processes and workflows. </p>
